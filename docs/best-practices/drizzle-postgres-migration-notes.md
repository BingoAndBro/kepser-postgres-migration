# Drizzle PostgreSQL Migration Notes

## Migration Strategy

Use Drizzle in codebase-first mode for the new local PostgreSQL schema. The migration target is not to mirror Supabase blindly, but to preserve behavior while designing a clean PostgreSQL schema from scratch.

Guidance:

- Generate SQL migrations from reviewed Drizzle schema changes.
- Review generated SQL before applying.
- Do not use direct push as the production migration path.
- Keep migration files in version control.
- Keep schema and migration table configuration explicit.

## Schema Organization

Use PostgreSQL schemas for domain separation:

- `auth`
- `master`
- `dokumen`
- `arsip`
- `app`

Drizzle supports PostgreSQL schemas through `pgSchema`, and generated queries qualify tables with the schema name.

Recommended organization:

- Group Drizzle schema files by domain.
- Export a single schema index for the Drizzle client.
- Keep enums close to the domain that owns them.
- Use explicit foreign key indexes for frequently joined columns.
- Use timestamp with timezone for time-sensitive columns.

## Multi-Schema PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL schemas are namespaces inside a database. They help organize objects and avoid name collisions, but they are not strict security boundaries by themselves. Privileges and application authorization still matter.

Migration implication:

- Use schemas for clarity and future RLS readiness.
- Do not rely on schema names as authorization.
- Qualify table references consistently.
- Decide `search_path` deliberately if any raw SQL is used.

## Seed Strategy

Seeds should be deterministic and minimal:

- Roles.
- Bootstrap admin account.
- Required master data.
- Small workflow fixtures only if needed for tests.

Avoid restoring Supabase dummy data. If realistic test data is needed later, create seed scripts that are explicit, repeatable, and safe to reset.

## Avoiding Behavior Drift

Before migrating an endpoint:

- Capture current request shape.
- Capture current response shape.
- Capture role/authorization behavior.
- Capture empty/error behavior.
- Capture date/status naming behavior.

Prefer read-only endpoint migration before mutation migration. Use transactions for write flows involving documents, files, and audit logs.
